# project-euler
Solutions to Project Euler that I have done. Some solutions use intermediate methods that I found online. Aside from that, all solutions and logic are based on my own work.

Note : Solutions and code are not the most optimal. This is more to learn than to optimize my code.
Problems are titled rather than numbered.

Will be updated regularly as I solve the problems.
